# Ruby Programming Guide

This is the source of the Ruby Programming Guide book. We developed this guide after teaching a few batches on Ruby programming basics.

This is a good guide if you are beginning programming, you work as an administer, software tester or manager who needs to understand a little bit about programming.

After going through all the chapters, you should be comfortable reading and also writing your own small pieces of Ruby.

We have an accompanying guide who the exercise to practice as well.
