# Numbers

## Numbers Inheritance Hierarchy

![Numbers Inheritance](/images/numbers.png)

`Numeric` is the class from which all higher-level numeric classes should inherit. Classes such as `Integer` inherit from the `Numeric` class. Numeric contains methods such as `abs`, `ceil`, `zero?`, `negative?`, `to_int` and more.

* The `Integer` class is the parent for the `Fixnum` and `BigNum`.
* `Fixnum` is used for fixed length numbers. `BigNum` holds numbers that cannot fit in a Fixnum. The conversion happens automatically.
* `Float` represent floating-point numbers.
* `Complex` represents complex numbers, numbers in the form `a+b_i_` where _i_ is an imaginary number.
* `Rational` represents rational numbers, numbers in the form `a/b`.

## Creating Numbers

We can create number types from their literal values e,g :

```ruby
irb(main):098:0> n = 10
=> 10
irb(main):099:0> n.class
=> Integer
```

We can check what type `n` is using the `class` method or using the `is_a?` method as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):100:0> n.is_a? Integer
=> true
```

Or if its a `Float` type we can use the `is_float?` :

```ruby
irb(main):101:0> n.is_a? Float
=> false
```

## Numeric Alterations

Numeric types allows for performing mathematical calculations.

```ruby
irb(main):105:0> n = 20
=> 20
irb(main):106:0> n = n+ 2
=> 22
```

```ruby
irb(main):107:0> n = n / 2.0
=> 11.0
irb(main):108:0> n.class
=> Float
irb(main):109:0> n.is_a? Numeric
=> true
```

We can also call methods on the numeric types e.g to get the absolute value as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):111:0> n = -10
=> -10
irb(main):112:0> n.abs
=> 10
```

Get the ceiling using the `ceiling` as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):114:0> n = 10.6
=> 10.6
irb(main):115:0> n.ceil
=> 11
```

 and also the floor using the `floor` function as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):117:0> n = 10.6
=> 10.6
irb(main):118:0> n.floor
=> 10
```

We can also round integer values using the `round` function as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):119:0> n = 10.6
=> 10.6
irb(main):120:0> n.round
=> 11
```

or round down :

```ruby
irb(main):121:0> n = 10.2
=> 10.2
irb(main):122:0> n.round
=> 10
```

## Numeric Comparison

We can perform numeric comparison using the number class.

```ruby
>> n = 10
=> 10
>> n == 10
=> true
>> n < 5
=> false
>> n <= 12
=> true
>> n == 10.00
=> true
```

We can also compare the number using the spaceship operator as follows :

```ruby
>> 10 <=> 11
=> -1
>> 10 <=> 9
=> 1
>> 10 <=> 10
=> 0
```

We can check if the two values are equal using the `eql?` method as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):123:0> 10.eql? 10
=> true
irb(main):124:0> 10.eql? 10.0
=> false
```

Check if the values are even or odd as follows :

```ruby
>> 10.odd?
=> false
>> 10.even?
=> true
```

Check if the number is between a specific range as follows :

```ruby
>> 10.between?(3,12)
=> true
```

We can use the iterators and count up to or down to a specified number as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):126:0> 1.upto(3) {|n| p n}
1
2
3
=> 1
```

or going down as follows :

```ruby
irb(main):127:0> 3.downto(1) {|n| p n}
3
2
1
=> 3
```

## Parsing Numbers

We can get the corresponding number represented as a string :

```ruby
'400'.to_i       # => 400
'3.14'.to_f      # => 3.14
'1.602e-19'.to_f # => 1.602e-19
```

The `to_i` coverts the number to an Integer and the `to_f` converts the number into a Float.
We can also pass in parameters to the methods to specify the base for the `to_i` method :

```ruby
'405'.to_i(8)  # 261
'405'.oct      # 261
'405'.hex      # 1029
'405'.to_i(16) # 1029
```

We can also convert numbers to their corresponding string in binary, octal, or hex as follows :

```ruby
405.to_s(2)     # 110010101
405.to_s(16)    # 195
```


You can use the `Integer` and `Float` classes to parse and these will throw errors if the string can't be parsed.

```ruby
Integer('405')          # 405
i = Integer('405ab')    # ArgumentError: invalid value for Integer(): "405ab"
Float('4.5')            # 4.5
Float('4.5f')           # ArgumentError: invalid value for Float(): "4.5f"
```

The Integer `to_s` can create a string representation in every integer base. The String `to_i` can parse a string to a number in a supported base.

```ruby
"-1001001".to_i(2)  # -73
"abc".to_i(16)      # 2748

-73.to_s(2)         #  "-1001001"
2748.to_s(16)       # 2748
```



## Random Numbers

The `rand` method is used to generate random numbers.  `rand` returns a pseudo-random floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, including 0.0 and excluding 1.0.

```ruby
rand    # 0.7376536979277991
rand    # 0.7906867058221021
```

If we pass in a value *n*, it will generate a number between *0* and *n - 1*.

```ruby
rand(10) # generates numbers between 0 and 9
rand(5..10) # generates numbers between 5 and 10
```

## Exercise

1. Create a routine that generates random numbers
2. Select a random value from a hash. Create an hash, here is a sample :

    ```ruby
    m = { key1: 'value1',
            key2: 'value2',
            key3: 'value3' }
    ```
3. Find the average, median and mode for a set of numbers passed in as an array. Test with the following :

    ```ruby
    mean([1,2,3,4]) # => 2.5
    ```
4. We have a set of players that participated in different games as follows :

    ```ruby
    games = [["Alice", "Bob"], ["Carol", "Ted"], ["Alice", "Mallory"], ["Ted", "Bob"]]
    ``` 

    Write code to only show the unique players that participated. The set of players should not contain duplicates.
    Expected output should be `"Alice", "Mallory", "Ted", "Carol", "Bob"`
5. Use the Luhn algorithm to verify a credit card number. More information on how the algorithm works is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

## Solution

1. They are many ways to to this. Use the `rand` methods as follows to generate a random number :

    ```ruby
    rand(47) # generate a random number bewtween 0 and 47
    ```
2. We can first extract the values from the array and then choose each one at random.

    ```ruby
    m.values.sample  # the values method returns all values as an array
    m[m.keys.sample] # longer version, get the random key and use it to find a value
    ```
3. Here is the sample solution for finding the mean, media and mode.

    ```ruby
    # mean
    def mean(array)
    array.inject(array.inject(0) { |sum, x| sum += x } / array.size.to_f
    end

    # median
    def median(array, already_sorted=false)
        return nil if array.empty?
        array = array.sort unless already_sorted
        m_pos = array.size / 2
        array.size % 2 == 1 ? array[m_pos] : mean(array[m_pos-1..m_pos])
    end

    def modes(array, find_all=true)
        histogram = array.inject(Hash.new(0)) { |h, n| h[n] += 1; h }
        modes = nil
        histogram.each_pair do |item, times|
            modes << item if modes && times == modes[0] and find_all
            modes = [times, item] if (!modes && times > 1) or (modes && times > modes[0])
        end
        modes ? modes[1â€¦modes.size] : modes
    end

    mean([1,2,3,4]) # => 2.5
    median([1,2,3,4,5]) # => 3
    modes([1,2,3,4]) # => nil
    modes([1,1,2,3,4]) # => [1]
    modes([1,1,2,2,3,4]) # => [1, 2]
    modes([1,1,2,2,3,4,4]) # => [1, 2, 4]
    modes([1,1,2,2,3,4,4], false) # => [1]
    ```
4. We can use the `Set` class found in the set standard library. We will need to require it as follows :

    ```ruby
    require 'set'

    games = [["Alice", "Bob"], ["Carol", "Ted"], ["Alice", "Mallory"], ["Ted", "Bob"]]
    players = games.inject(Set.new) { |set, game| game.each { |p| set << p }; set }
    ```

    We can also convert an array to a set using the `to_set` method. This wil remove duplicates.
5. Many implementations of the algorithm.
